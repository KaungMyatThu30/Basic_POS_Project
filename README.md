📦 Data Configuration
Product Catalog File (pos_item.json)

Place your JSON file here:

src/data/pos_item.json

Example import:

import productData from "../data/pos_item.json";

Runtime Storage (LocalStorage)

This project uses LocalStorage for saving runtime changes:

Products & Inventory

Key: pos_products_runtime

Stock reduces when recording sale

Extra items are stored here too

Transactions

Key: pos_transactions

This means you can refresh the page and still keep inventory + transactions.
